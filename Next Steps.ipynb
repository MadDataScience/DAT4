      "2. **Data Hackers**  *'the one eyed man in the kingdom of the blind'*...people with a bit of skill, maybe a bit of training, but they aren't at the level of sophistication of an operator...don't mistake knowing how to apply one Machine Learning technique for actual knowledge. \n",
      "3. **Data Operators** *or* **Resident Data Scientists** take predefined algorithms, statistical or machine learning, and then apply them to a specific company scenario and most crucially keep the parameters up to date so the algorithm continues to perform. \n",
      "4. **Data Magicians** normally have mathematical or physics centric PhDs (often several), often focused in specific areas such as fluid dynamics, economics or super specific such as wind-turbines... The reason its science is because its testable and provable.  They can show that their algorithm would have produced 5% improvement in performance over the past 5 years, and as it moves forward show how their approach has made a difference to the performance of a business."
